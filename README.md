#### Description

Emulation of a digital wristwatch with its alarm set for 8:15PM nightly.

This highly specific application emulates a casio wristwatch watch that my good friend Andy had that ran continuously for over 5 years every night at 8:15. 

It was agreed upon that this alarm time was the most optimal alarm time possible and was celebrated nightly.

Recently, this alarm was turned off, and I was interested in Android development - spawning is project.

#### Development notes

Much of the development was inspired by the hasCode blog's entry [Managing Background Tasks on Android using the Alarm Manager](http://www.hascode.com/2011/11/managing-background-tasks-on-android-using-the-alarm-manager/) as well as a very helpful [post](http://commonsware.com/blog/2011/07/05/boot-completed-regression.html) regarding the necessity for an actiity in my application.
