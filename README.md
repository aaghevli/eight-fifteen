#### Description

Emulation of a digital wristwatch with its alarm set for 8:15PM nightly.

This highly specific application emulates a casio wristwatch watch alarm that my good friend Andy had set 5+ years ago to 8:15PM. 

It was agreed upon that this alarm time was the most optimal alarm time possible and was celebrated nightly.

Recently, this alarm was turned off, and I believe my awareness of the passing 8:15 has suffered as a result. 

Also, I wanted to learn Android development.

#### Development notes

Much of the development was inspired by the hasCode blog's entry [Managing Background Tasks on Android using the Alarm Manager](http://www.hascode.com/2011/11/managing-background-tasks-on-android-using-the-alarm-manager/) as well as a very helpful [post](http://commonsware.com/blog/2011/07/05/boot-completed-regression.html) regarding the necessity for an activity in an application that responds to BOOT_COMPLETED.
